# INSIDE
There's too much that's going on, I don't know what to do  
Paralyzed by options in this world, can't pick and choose, yeah  
Everybody's life is on display including you  
Yet, I feel everyday is just the same, stuck in a loop  
I need some variety, I'm sick of this anxiety  
I'm sick of this society, they make us feel a rivalry  
Compare ourselves to others, but we all got different mothers  
We were raised in different structures  
So, we're different, it's no wonder, yeah  
I just want a great life  
Something where I feel like I just didn't waste time  
Something I look back and say, "That was a great time"  
'Cause, man, I just hate when the years pass by the wayside, yeah  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm so lost inside and I need a little time to find  
Who I am in this life, I will find a way to feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm so lost inside and I need a little time to find  
Who I am in this life, I will find a way to feel alive  
Feel alive, feel alive, I'm so lost inside  
And I need a little time to find who I am inside  
  
[Verse 2]  
You better watch out now, I figured something out  
What this whole life's about, yeah  
It's not the goal, it's the journey  
Wasted emotion is worry  
I'll stop being in a hurry and  
I'll just enjoy what I'm doing  
Keep pushing forward and moving  
Appreciate the improvement, yeah  
I was so stuck on a goal, was losing sight of my soul  
Need to enjoy getting old and be so present  
I don't know if there's a Heaven, but I know I wanna get in  
And sometimes I feel a presence, energy in a direction  
So, I follow intuition, it took me to a musician  
Now I'm on a different mission to help others with afflictions (Afflictions)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Now I'm not lost inside, I finally have seemed to find  
Who I am in this life and I found a way to feel alive  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not lost inside, I finally have seemed to find  
Who I am in this life and I found a way to feel alive  
Feel alive, feel alive, I'm not lost inside  
I finally have seemed to find who I am inside
